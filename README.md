# Snake
The classic 'snake' game, written in processing. Meant to be a Mac OSX executable application.

Instructions: 
 - Use the arrow keys to move the snake
 - Get the orange food, which increases both your snake's length and the game score by 1
 - You die if you (the snake) hits a wall, or collides with itself
 - Try to get as high of a score as possible
